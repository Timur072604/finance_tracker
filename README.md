# finance_tracker
My first small web application for personal finance tracking.

To run the project, open the console and write "npm i".
Then launch Apache and MySQL through any program, for example XAMPP Control Panel, then in phpMyAdmin create a database with name "budget-tracker" and with the encoding utf8mb4_general_ci.
Type "npm run dev" in the console to start the database. Open a second console and type "npm run serve" to run the project, a link will appear in the second console, click on it to use the web application.
